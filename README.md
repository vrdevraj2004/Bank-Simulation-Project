PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project simulates a banking system using Java and JavaFX. It allows Managers and Customers to log in and perform role-specific actions such as managing accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, and making online purchases. The system uses a state-based approach to control user actions depending on whether they are logged in or out.

FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES

Managers can add or delete customer accounts, while customers can view their balance and perform transactions. Customer information is stored in text files, allowing data to persist across sessions. The JavaFX interface provides an interactive and user-friendly experience for both roles.

DEVELOPMENT & TESTING ENVIRONMENT

The project was developed in NetBeans IDE and tested in a VirtualBox environment. It uses object-oriented programming principles with abstract classes and state-based design to ensure scalability and maintainability.
